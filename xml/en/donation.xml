Thank you very much for all your support of the nginx project.
We as a company have created a commercial model to help support
the ongoing development of the software, so we no longer need to
ask for charitable donations to support our work.
If you use and enjoy nginx, and want to support the project please
consider purchasing one of our paid products and services.
You can learn more at <link url="https://nginx.com">nginx.com</link>.
